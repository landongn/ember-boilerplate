##Why this instead of yo ember:app or ember-starter-kit?

- Yeoman's generator is broken currently and there's something going on over here as to why it's being held up
- grunt-ember-templates is out of date specifically regarding the newest handlebars runtime
- this is a boilerplate specifically for me; so it's including zurb-foundation for sass.
- because, that's why.

Clone, ```npm install``` and then ```grunt start```.
